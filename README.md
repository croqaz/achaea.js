# Achaea.js

An [Achaea.com](https://achaea.com/) MUD client.

## Why?

Because it's an interesting programming project.
Because all the other MUD clients are not flexible enough for my needs.
All the desktop clients use either LUA, or custom & weird scripting languages.

## Features

**GMCP**: always enabled. It will populate a STATE tree, which includes info about your character and your location.
**Logging**: always enabled. All your input commands and game text are saved as plain text.
Some aliases, triggers, auto-commands & all that good stuff.

## Usage

This is a Node.js project.
Git clone, Npm install, then run:

$ node main.js

Type your user & password and start playing Achaea.
