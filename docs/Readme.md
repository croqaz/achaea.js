# Achaea

This MUD client is built for Achaea. It will not work with any other MUDs.
This is great, because it's specifically optimized for a single usecase.

## Getting started

After you installed Bun, clone this code and run `bun install` to make sure you have all the Javasctip dependencies installed.

Next, copy the folder `example/` and rename the copy to `custom/`.

Check the README in that folder and check the `docs/` to see what to do next.

Please try to AVOID changing the code in the `achaea/` folder, if you want to fetch the latest changes. If make changes, you'll have merge conflicts and you're on your own.
