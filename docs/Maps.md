# Maps

The game maps are using the official Achaea data.

The map widget similar to the Mudlet & Nexus maps, but written from scratch using [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org).

You can find a standalone version of the maps at: https://github.com/croqaz/achaea-map ; This was later integrated in the MUD client.
